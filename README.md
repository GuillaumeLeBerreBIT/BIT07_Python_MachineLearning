# BIT07_Python_MachineLearning
 The most used programming language for machine learning is Python. Using Jupyter Notebook, an open-source web application running Python in the background. The different machine learning techniques like classification, clustering and dimensionality reduction are discussed. Learns to create models for each of these techniques and tries to improve them by hyperparameter tuning. Finally, the models are tested using, for the model, unseen data. A conclusion about these results is formulated. The focus of this course unit is, as much as possible, focused on bioinformatics applications.
