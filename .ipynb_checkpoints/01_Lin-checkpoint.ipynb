    "# Linear regression\n",
    "The goal of regression is to perform predictions of continuous values using a trained model. We want to find a relationship between one or multiple features and a specific output variable we call 'y'. \n",

    "The goals of this exercise are:\n",
    "* Read in data and process it using the pandas library\n",
    "* Perform simple statistic analyses on the data to detect inconsistencies of the data and see correlations between features and/or target\n",
